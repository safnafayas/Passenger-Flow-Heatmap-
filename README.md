Passenger Flow Heatmap – Identifying Busiest Routes &amp; Times (TTC Data Project)

📌 Objective:

Identify peak congestion times and busiest TTC routes/stations.
Help optimize scheduling by visualizing ridership patterns.
Show trends using heatmaps and dashboards.

📌 Data Sources:

TTC Ridership Data (hourly, daily, station-level)
TTC GPS & Real-time Transit Data
TTC Service Alerts (to analyze impact of delays)
Weather Data (to analyze its effect on ridership)

📌 Tools & Technologies:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Folium)
SQL (if using relational databases)
Power BI / Tableau (for interactive heatmaps)

1️⃣ Passenger Flow Heatmap (Core Analysis)
📌 Goal: Identify Toronto’s busiest TTC routes and peak hours.
📌 How:

Use GTFS data to map transit routes & schedules.
Use Ridership (Ranking-Surface Routes) to find the most used routes.
Create a heatmap of busiest routes & times (weekday, weekend, hourly).
✅ Key Insights:

Which TTC routes see the highest ridership?
What are the peak hours for different routes?
Are streetcars or buses more crowded during rush hours?
2️⃣ Impact of Climate on Ridership & Transit Efficiency
📌 Goal: Understand how weather conditions affect TTC usage.
📌 How:

Merge Climate Variables with Ridership Data (by date & time).
Analyze how extreme temperatures, rain, or snow impact ridership.
Check if freezing rain or heatwaves cause delays or route changes (GTFS).
✅ Key Insights:

Does bad weather reduce ridership?
Do hot summers increase ridership (AC buses)?
Do cold winters increase bus/streetcar delays?
3️⃣ Route Optimization & Service Planning
📌 Goal: Help TTC improve schedules based on real ridership trends.
📌 How:

Compare planned GTFS schedules vs. actual ridership.
Find routes that are consistently overcrowded & need more service.
Identify low-ridership routes (may need fewer vehicles or changes).
✅ Key Insights:

Should TTC increase service on certain routes during bad weather?
Are bus schedules aligned with real ridership trends?
Do certain routes need more frequent service during peak hours?
4️⃣ Predicting Future Transit Demand
📌 Goal: Use climate projections to see how ridership might change.
📌 How:

Analyze past ridership trends in extreme weather.
Use future climate scenarios to estimate how ridership may change.
Suggest TTC infrastructure & scheduling improvements for the future.
✅ Key Insights:

Will Toronto need more buses/streetcars in extreme summers?
Should TTC invest in weather-resistant infrastructure?
How will changing weather impact daily commutes?
🚀 Unique Project Idea: "Weather-Optimized Transit Planning"
💡 Final Deliverables:
✅ Heatmap of busiest routes & times.
✅ Charts showing ridership changes in different weather conditions.
✅ TTC service recommendations based on data.
